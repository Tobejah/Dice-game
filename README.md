### Usage

To run the game, the user simply has to press the run button on he's or her computer. It is a pig dice game. The game starts off by asking the user to imput he's or her name and then the game begins. The user is then asked if he or she would like to roll a dice, stop playing, hold he's or her current score, win early, or leave the game. Depending on the user's choice a sequence or actions take place. 

Clicking the role button will allow the user roll the dice up until the user either rolls a 1 or chooses to hold the turn score. The sum of the numbers rolled is then added up. The aim of the game is to reach a total score of 50 before the computer does. Clicking the hold button will allow the user to hold he's or her turn score, protecting it in the case the user should roll a 1 in he's next turn. Clicking this button allows you to protect your turn score after which the computer begins to play. Clicking the win button allows to user to cheat and gives the user the opportunity to win early. This button instantly awards the user 40 points meaning the user needs just 10 points to win the game and finally clicking the exit button allows the user to leave the game.
